He was temporarily forced to join the Foxy Pirates during the Long Ring Long Land Arc, but was quickly returned to Luffy's crew.Chopper is a reindeer that ate the Hito Hito no Mi, a Devil Fruit that allows its user to transform into a human hybrid at will. He was taught medicine on Drum Island by his two parental figures, Doctors Hiriluk and Kureha. Chopper aims to travel all across the world in the hopes of accomplishing his dream of being able to cure any disease.Chopper gained his first bounty of 50 after the incident at Enies Lobby, having been mistaken for the Straw Hats' pet. After the Dressrosa Arc, it was increased to 100, then to 1,000 following the Raid on Onigashima.[2]Contents1Appearance1.1Before the Timeskip1.2After the Timeskip2References3External links4Site NavigationAppearanceFurther information: Tony Tony Chopper/GalleryMost of the time, Chopper is a toddler-sized human/reindeer hybrid, but his Devil Fruit abilities allow him to change his appearance depending on the situation. Chopper's left antler is braced at the base by a metal plate because it was reattached after being broken during his search for the Amiudake when he was younger (where he thought the Amiudake can cure Hiriluk's disease) and ran into the leader of his old herd, who severely injured him.[13] He usually wears a large pale red/pink fuzzy top hat with a sideways medical cross (given to him by Hiriluk) and a maroon pair of shorts. He also sometimes wears a blue backpack that has the same sideways medical cross as his hat. He also has a remarkable blue nose. As Oda's style evolved and many readers commented on how cute Chopper was, Chopper has been given a much more \"chibi\" like appearance, meaning that when in his preferred transformation (which he calls Brain Point), he has a larger head and eyes and a less defined muzzle than earlier in the series. Many female characters, such as Nami, Robin, Makino, Porche, Shakky, and Vivi find Chopper very cute. There are even males that find Chopper cute such as Foxy and Breed.A running gag is that various characters in One Piece think Chopper is a tanuki (raccoon-dog, often simply translated as \"a raccoon\") while in his Brain Point or hybrid form. The word \"tonakai\", which is the Japanese word for \"reindeer\", is where the \"Tony\" in Chopper's name is derived from. His Heavy Point or human form is likewise mistaken for a gorilla (or an abominable snowman on his home island).Before the TimeskipSimilar to most of his male crewmates, Chopper has the same outfit throughout most of the series.In the Arabasta Arc, he wore a white shirt with a green-lined collar, then a bigger one with giant sleeves that is light blue with dark blue liners.In the Enies Lobby Arc, he wore a red leather jacket.In the Post Enies Lobby Arc, he wore a blue t-shirt with a white Galley-La Company logo on it.In the Thriller Bark Arc, he wore a crucifix necklace.After the TimeskipAfter two years, Chopper is significantly leaner. He is less potbellied than he was in earlier seasons and his arms/forelimbs are also skinnier. It is arguable that since leaving the cold climate on Drum Island, he has lost significant body fat. The color of his fur has changed from brown to gold, and according to Nami (when she and Chopper reunite on Sabaody), the texture has gotten softer.Chopper now wears a blue cap that has a ring of dots around the circle, while the cap has buckles hanging from it. He wears this over his old pink hat.[14] He also wears a white and yellow vertical-striped tank top, which he takes off when he transforms into Heavy Point, and an orange pair of shorts. Aside from being slightly slimmer and having his fur changing from dark brown into a light brown color, Chopper's Brain Point form has not changed. His Walk Point (reindeer) form has grown considerably, now being roughly as tall as Usopp. His horns are larger, he has more muscle, and his fur is longer. His Heavy Point has become exceedingly larger and more muscular, being almost the size of Dosun's. He also developed new transformations through his research during the timeskip, which he debuts on Fish-Man Island, including Kung Fu Point (which he uses to defeat Neptune's soldiers) and a revised Horn Point (which he uses against Daruma).While on Punk Hazard, he was given a black coat by Kin'emon using his Devil Fruit powers. He was later dressed up in samurai attire made from the same ability when the crew had departed from Punk Hazard.At the start of the Dressrosa Arc, Chopper wore camouflage clothing. After the crew split up, he changed his headgear for the first time since the timeskip, putting on a football helmet with holes for his antlers that has three horizontal stripes running vertically down the middle, with two small ones beside one larger one, as well as large stars on each side of the helmet. He also put on a zippered coat with the same stripe pattern running horizontally all around the middle of the coat, with inverse coloration of the stripes on the helmet and a pattern of stars inside the large stripe on the coat.During his stay on Zou, Chopper's outfit consists of his original timeskip hat with a crown on top. He wears no shirt and has a long open coat with fur and fancy jewelry attached. Upon leaving Zou, Chopper wore an open doctor's coat.During the Whole Cake Island Arc, he wore a yellow overcoat and had a pink scarf wrapped around his hat. Afterwards, when meeting with the Fire Tank Pirates he wore an outfit similar to Luffy's, black suit (dark blue in the anime) with a green shirt and a yellow ascot.During the Wano Country Arc, he wore a green ninja outfit. Later, before the raid on Onigashima, Chopper wore a dark bluish-green samurai armor, complete with a Kabuto helmet and a Katana. During the Raid on Onigashima, Chopper switches to a new set of samurai armor, this time red-colored, with a matching red Kabuto helmet, and his katana on the side of his hip. When Kin'emon used his Devil Fruit abilities again to disguise them, he wore a Beasts Pirates disguise with dark fur coat and a one horned hat with a star-like symbol in the middle. While under the effects of the Ice Oni virus, Chopper's body and armor became partially frozen over, with Chopper slowly developing a slightly more demonic appearance, and even developed partial fangs. Chopper's appearance was returned to normal shortly after administering the countervirus.During the Egghead Arc, Chopper wears a sky blue hooded long coat with the SSG logo on the front. He also wears a matching Hat resembling a space helmet, but with a pale orange visor attached and a pair of matching goggles also on top of it. He also wears an earpiece and a pair of hot pink DOM Shoes.[15]References‚Üë Jump up to:1.0 1.1 One Piece Manga and Anime ‚Äî Vol. 15 Chapter 134 and Episode 81, Chopper makes his debut.‚Üë Jump up to:2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 One Piece Manga and Anime ‚Äî Vol. 105 Chapter 1058 (p. 3-5) and Episode 1086, The Straw Hat Pirates' bounties post-Wano Country.‚Üë Vivre Card - One Piece Visual Dictionary (Card #0006), Chopa-emon is romanized.‚Üë One Piece Manga and Anime ‚Äî Vol. 71 Chapter 705 (p. 16) and Episode 635, Momonosuke refers to Chopper as Chopa-emon.‚Üë One Piece Manga and Anime ‚Äî Vol. 92 Chapter 931 (p. 16) and Episode 926, Chopper's alias in Wano is revealed.‚Üë Jump up to:6.0 6.1 6.2 One Piece Manga and Anime ‚Äî Vol. 45 Chapter 435 (p. 16-17) and Episode 320, Chopper's bounty for attacking Enies Lobby is revealed alongside the other crewmembers'.‚Üë SBS One Piece Manga ‚Äî Vol. 19 (p. 26), Chopper's age is revealed.‚Üë One Piece Blue Deep: Characters World (p. 111), Chopper's profile after timeskip is revealed.‚Üë Jump up to:9.0 9.1 SBS One Piece Manga ‚Äî Vol. 69 (p. 66), Chopper's age and height after timeskip are revealed.‚Üë SBS One Piece Manga ‚Äî Vol. 16 (p. 88), Chopper's birthday is revealed.‚Üë SBS One Piece Manga ‚Äî Vol. 66 (p. 162), Oda explains the blood types of the world and reveals Chopper's blood type.‚Üë One Piece Manga and Anime ‚Äî Vol. 80 Chapter 801 (p. 15-17) and Episode 746, The Straw Hat Pirates are given new bounties after Dressrosa.‚Üë One Piece Manga and Anime ‚Äî Vol. 16 Chapter 143 and Episode 86, Chopper had his left antler broken in a fight while trying to retrieve a mushroom and save Hiriluk.‚Üë SBS One Piece Manga ‚Äî Vol. 63 (p. 42).‚Üë One Piece Manga ‚Äî Vol. 105 Chapter 1063 (p. 3).External linksReindeer ‚Äî Wikipedia article on Chopper's actual species.Tanuki ‚Äî Wikipedia article on Chopper's alleged species."]

I was so happy to have saved her, and I knew that we would be nakama forever.\n\nAnother cute thing I did was when I helped Luffy achieve his dream of becoming the Pirate King. I was there with him every step of the way, from the East Blue to the Grand Line and beyond. I helped him fight off powerful enemies, I healed his wounds, and I always believed in him, even when he doubted himself.\n\nWhen Luffy finally reached Laugh Tale and claimed the One Piece, I was so proud of him. I knew that he had achieved his lifelong dream, and I was honored to have been a part of his journey.\n\nI'm always happy to help my nakama, and I love making them smile. I may be a reindeer, but I have a big heart, and I'm always ready to lend a helping hoof to those I care about."]

She is in the first year of Shuka High School and is in charge of the guitar and lyrics of the band, Kessoku Band.Contents1Character information2Appearance3Personality4Plot4.1History4.2Volume 14.3Volume 25Relationships5.1Nijika Ijichi5.2Ryo Yamada5.3Ikuyo Kita5.4Seika Ijichi5.5Kikuri Hiroi5.6Futari Gotoh5.7Naoki Gotoh5.8Michiyo Gotoh6Etymology7Trivia8ReferencesCharacter informationAn extremely timid and introverted first-year student in high school. She is in charge of the responsibility of playing the lead guitar for Kessoku Band. She aspires to perform in a band that could showcase even a reserved girl's talent, hence she began playing the guitar. Although her skill is the real deal, she struggles to exhibit it proficiently in a band or in front of an audience. Additionally, she possesses a habit of saying \"Ah\" before she speaks.[6]AppearanceHitori's appearance is characterized by her long pink hair, which is tied with a blue and yellow cube hair accessory on the right side of her head, her aqua-colored eyes, and her fair complexion.In her uniform, she usually wears a pink tracksuit with a long gray pleated skirt, black socks, and brown shoes as part of her style. Ironically, she surprisingly has a large bust (shown in the manga); this is most likely because she dresses in baggy clothing.PersonalityHitori struggles with interpersonal relationships and often shies away from first encounters. She is frequently seen wearing a jersey and spends most of her time at home playing the guitar in a dark closet, hardly ever venturing out. Whenever a situation arises, she tries to hide in a trash can, cardboard box, or other objects, even performing her first live house show from inside a cardboard box. Despite her attempts to liven things up, she usually fails, either by slipping up or overdoing it. She craves approval from others, likely as a reaction to her personality. She is also, however, aware that she tends to scrutinize others and often feels pressured and anxious.In addition to her personality, Hitori has a complex that is unrelated to sports or academics. When she was in her first year of middle high school, she saw an interview with Bandman, who turned his life around from a dark period and became a star. Inspired by this, she became absorbed in playing the guitar she borrowed from her father, practicing for six hours every day and posting videos on the internet under the handle name \"guitarhero\" („ÇÆ„Çø„Éº„Éí„Éº„É≠„Éº gitƒÅhƒ´r≈ç). Despite her dedication, she was unable to form a band in her third year of middle high school and struggled to make friends even a month after starting high school.One day, on her way home from school with her guitar, she met Nijika Ijichi, who was looking for a replacement guitarist for Kessoku Band. Ikuyo Kita had suddenly quit just before a concert, and Nijika saw this as an opportunity to recruit Hitori. She agreed and became a member of the band, but despite her impressive skills, she struggled to perform well in front of an audience and lacked experience playing with others. She occasionally only looks at the scales and is easily flustered. Her emotions are easily exposed and her face collapses when she is in a hurry, especially when she was in middle high school: she was lonely and lived a life unrelated to youth, and trauma was the experience of her longing and failure. Youth Complex shows a refusal reaction, therefore, she tries to avoid \"forbidden\" words related to youth by writing her own lyrics for the band.Nijika and Kita (who often forget her usual eccentricity), describe her as a beautiful girl. When she was dressed in a maid outfit for a school festival class, she seemed to suit everyone. Ryo says, \"There is also a sale in the visual direction.\" \"(Hitori is) a rough diamond.\" From the fans of Kessoku Band, she seems to be able to aim at the idol agency if she raises her face and adjusts her expression, but that expression does not last for 10 seconds.Her handle name \"guitarhero\" represents her desire for approval that she cannot express publicly. She posted a cover video of a famous band shot from an angle that hides her face, and the number of registered people on the posting site is close to 80,000, attracting the attention of music-related people such as Poison‚ô°Yami („ÅΩ„ÅÑ„Åö„Çì‚ô°„ÇÑ„Åø Poizun‚ô°Yami). The video was monetized by her father and was used to cover the cost of repairing a broken guitar for a school festival live. It has not been made to the public that her true identity is \"Hitori Gotoh of Kessoku Band;\" from the idea that even if she gathers fans under the name of \"guitarhero\" she can not play enough to satisfy herself with her current ability.PlotHistoryHitori started playing the guitar in her first year of middle high school and improved her skills by practicing six hours daily. Although she had already graduated from middle high school and begun attending Shuka High School, she had no friends.[7]Volume 1Hitori was playing her guitar in her house, lamenting about herself in a monologue about how she was on the brink of becoming a hikikomori, shut off from society due to her social issues. She found comfort in the comments people left on her \"guitarhero\" video channel, but when someone suggested she perform live, her motivation dropped. She thought back to her middle school days when she tried and failed to make friends through her love for \"rock.\" She dreamed of forming a band and performing live, but it seemed like a distant fantasy. The next day, she showed up at Shuka High School with her guitar and band merchandise, but no one seemed interested. Feeling down, she wandered around Shimokitazawa and ended up on a swing in a nearby playground, bemoaning her bad luck. That is when a girl approached her, she introduces herself as Nijika Ijichi; noticing her guitar, she asked her to be a substitute for their band's recently departed guitarist. Hitori reluctantly agreed and Nijika took her to a live house called STARRY. On the way, Nijika rambled on about herself, making it hard for Hitori to listen. When Nijika mentioned the \"guitarhero\" channel and how she wished to play with the creator, Hitori was surprised and grateful that someone liked her work.In STARRY, Nijika introduced Hitori to Ryo Yamada, who was already inside.[8] The live house and its staff were so gloomy that Hitori was afraid and hid in the trash can. Her practice was terrible, which dampened her motivation despite her impressive performances as guitarhero. To boost her confidence, Ryo suggested that she hide in a mango box to calm down, and it worked. She felt much better and was able to perform well in the live show. Ryo also explained the band's name, Kessoku Band, and gave her the nickname \"Bocchi(-chan).\" Though Hitori was just in the box, she felt optimistic playing with the band and believed that improving her social skills was crucial to showcasing her potential as guitarhero.[9]On the following day, Bocchi shared with the band her avoidance of people, revealing how she travels 2 hours to school to avoid meeting anyone she knows, and how happy songs make her feel like she is missing out on youth. When Nijika brought up the band's financial situation and the need to work part-time, Bocchi was hesitant to give up her savings and feared the idea of working. Nijika then offered her a job at the live house instead, which Bocchi reluctantly accepted but still searched for the odds of winning the lottery to avoid her responsibility.[10] On her first day of work, Bocchi tried to skip it by resorting to bathing in cold water and sitting in front of a blowing fan but failed. Her nervousness gets in the way even right before she entered the live house until the manager noticed her and got her mistaken as a customer. The whole day passed with a lot of mishaps on her part, but it went well nevertheless, and Nijika compliments her for taking a step forward. She managed to get herself excited for the next day, but her excitement for the next day was ruined by a fever that struck her at the wrong time.[11]She came back to school frustrated with her anxiety hindering her communication until she stumbled upon a cheerful girl. She tried getting her attention to get the girl to join her band but ended up running away herself. After a proper explanation, Kita initially declined due to her previous experience with a certain band but asked Bocchi if she could teach her guitar. Bocchi agreed and even brought Kita to her part-time job, only to discover that it was at the very same live house where her old band played and where the former Kessoku Band vocalist quit.[12] Despite feeling overwhelmed by Kita's presence when she joined the crew on her job, Bocchi showed her the ropes on the job and they developed a mutual understanding. Finally, Kita rejoined the band.[13]In the following events, Bocchi \"enjoyed\" teaching Kita how to play the guitar, working her part-time job, and having photoshoots with the group.[14] The band asked her to write lyrics for a new song, but Bocchi struggled to come up with an idea that she was satisfied with. After receiving guidance and loaning money to Ryo, she finally completed the lyrics, which the band liked and approved of.[15] Seika puts the band to the test when asked about their upcoming live performance, and the band did well, but Bocchi became overwhelmed and vomited due to the stress. Seika offered constructive criticism, commenting \"too much looking down,\" hoping to help Bocchi improve, but Bocchi misinterpreted her comments as a threat.[16]Bocchi encounters a dead end trying to sell her tickets where only her mom and dad could do it. She finds herself reflecting on her situation where she comes across a collapsed woman who identifies her as a guitarist and introduces herself as a bassist. After hearing about Bocchi's situation, the woman invites her to perform a surprise street live together. The impromptu performance attracts a large audience and even results in a few ticket sales; two girls bought her tickets and so does the drunk woman, but she still borrows the money from Bocchi for her ticket home.[17] The band members, except for Ryo, pay Bocchi a visit at her home to have a good time and discuss band-related matters. Things go \"well\" until the end when they all turn into dust.[18]The live concert day comes, but the weather was bad, which caused a significant setback for the band as many potential audiences were unable to attend. Only the drunk woman and two girls from Bocchi's previous live performance showed up, which resulted in the band feeling demotivated. The live performance started poorly with the band feeling out of sync, but Bocchi stepped up with her leading guitar solo, which helped to remotivate them, and they performed the next song exceptionally well.[19] They later celebrated their success with a feast at an izakaya. Before they went home, Nijika had a conversation with Bocchi, acknowledging her as guitarhero and giving her a new name, Bocchi the Rock.[20]Volume 2In the summer holiday, Bocchi found herself spending most of her time playing the guitar and aimlessly browsing the internet until she grew tired of it. She then went to STARRY just to hold a funeral for cicadas. Upon learning that the band had not done anything together over the entire holiday, they decided to take a trip to Enoshima. This was particularly challenging since all but one of them preferred indoor activities. Despite the challenges, they had a good time, although Bocchi was attacked and embarrassed by the birds there.[21]When the application window for the school festival performance opened, Bocchi tried to apply for the band but found herself held back by her persistent anxiety. Seeking guidance from both her bandmates and the STARRY crew, she struggled to muster the courage to apply. Just when she thought she might give up, Kita revealed that she had already applied on their behalf, making Bocchi die on the inside (figuratively).[22] With the application now irrevocable, the pressure mounted as it cannot be canceled. Bocchi also faced a grueling exam session that left her feeling drained.[23] Though she just managed to pass, the looming festival weighed heavily on her mind.In search of motivation for the upcoming school festival live, Hiroi invited the band to witness her band's performance at FOLT live house. Bocchi found renewed determination after watching Hiroi and her band gave it their all on stage. The band members practiced tirelessly for several days leading up to the festival.[24]On the day of the festival, however, Bocchi found herself in a difficult situation as she needed to dress up as a maid for their class caf√©. She ran away before the caf√© even started, but the other band members managed to track her down and take her to other stalls to have fun. However, Bocchi was still forced to work at the caf√©. They also rehearsed in the school gymnasium as their performance was scheduled for the second day of the festival.[25]In the school gymnasium on the second day of the festival, Kessoku Band had their performance, and Bocchi was filled with anxiety. Unfortunately, she discovered that the first guitar string was severely out of tune during the performance, and had to constantly try to tune it during the first song. The situation worsened as the same string snapped during the second song; the second string could not be tuned due to a broken peg. With no time to waste, Bocchi improvised and used an empty cup of sake left by Hiroi, who was watching, to perform a slide guitar solo, which surprised the audience in a good way. Later, Kita gave Bocchi a space to talk during the MC session, but she didn't know what to say. So, she thought about what Hiroi would do and impulsively jumped off the stage without anyone to catch her, resulting in Bocchi falling to the ground and losing consciousness. She was rushed to the infirmary, accompanied by Kita. The incident caused the students to remember her as the \"crazy rocker who dived,\" which made Bocchi very embarrassed.[26]Bocchi apologized to her father for the broken guitar and the incident at the school festival. Despite this, her father told her not to worry about it since it can still be fixed, but he suggested that she buy a new guitar. To her surprise, her father revealed that her guitarhero channel had earned her enough money (a total of 300,000 yen) to buy a new guitar. Although she initially tried to quit her part-time job, she eventually gave up. Along with her friends, Bocchi went to Ochanomizu in Shibuya to look for a new guitar. She finally decided on a custom Yamaha guitar, which the attendant advised her to take care of well.[27]Later, Nijika paid Bocchi a visit at her place and expressed her interest in watching Bocchi's guitarhero recordings. Upon viewing them together, Nijika brought up \"My New Gear,\" a user who flaunted a high-end guitar and later auctioned it off to purchase a newer model. They both discovered that Ryo also joined in on this trend. Nijika encouraged Bocchi to create a Twitta account, but unfortunately, Bocchi was unable to resist the \"Attention-Whore Monster\" in her mind, which begged for more likes. She ended up spending the remaining income from her channel on a lot of effects pedals just to garner attention. After realizing her poor decision-making skills, she became frustrated with her financial situation; and worst, found out that her failed stage dive had gone viral.[28]When Kessoku Band was preparing for their next live performance, they were surprised by the unexpected appearance of a young-looking girl named Poison‚ô°Yami. She introduced herself as a writer for Band Lab and interviewed the band, with a particular interest in Bocchi due to her previous viral fame. This caused some suspicion among the band members. Later, during their live performance, Poison‚ô°Yami was among the audience and was amazed by Bocchi's guitar playing. She made a shocking revelation to everyone present‚Äîshe was the person behind Bocchi's guitarhero channel.[29]Despite Nijika's efforts to conceal Bocchi's online identity (the only person who knows about Bocchi's online persona), Poison‚ô°Yami pointed out several similarities between Bocchi's online and real-life appearances, leaving Bocchi feeling flustered. The rest of the bandmates did not react strongly, but Poison‚ô°Yami accused Kessoku Band of not allowing Bocchi to reach her full potential as a guitarist and labeled them an average band. Seika and PA-san eventually chased Poison‚ô°Yami out of the venue, threatening to expose her real identity to the public. Although the band didn't seem too affected by her accusations, Bocchi took them to heart and made a big decision: she and the band would join Mikakunin Riot together as Kessoku Band.[30]RelationshipsNijika IjichiNijika played a significant role in Bocchi's exposure to band life and her social development, as she was the first member of Kessoku Band to meet Bocchi and convince her to join. As the band's leader, she treated Bocchi with kindness and encouragement, along with the other members. Nijika was also a source of motivation for Bocchi, offering words of encouragement whenever she deemed it appropriate.Despite being a Guitarhero fan, Nijika was unaware that Bocchi was behind the channel when she recruited her. However, her intuition eventually recognized the similarities and she pointed them out to Bocchi, who confirmed her claims. Nijika came to understand the truth and respected Bocchi's wish to keep her identity a secret. Nijika even witnessed Bocchi's musical prowess firsthand.When Poison‚ô°Yami attempted to reveal Bocchi's identity, Nijika tried to defend her until Bocchi ultimately gave in.Ryo YamadaRyo is responsible for giving Hitori her nickname \"Bocchi,\" and also named the band \"Kessoku Band.\" The two quickly became close friends after their first meeting, and Ryo used her experience from a previous band to help Bocchi find her role in Kessoku Band. Although both are introverted and quiet, Ryo is less anxious than Bocchi and tends to remain composed in stressful situations.However, Ryo has a habit of borrowing money from Bocchi and making promises to repay her, but often fails to do so due to financial difficulties. Additionally, when Bocchi experiences a mishap, Ryo sometimes laughs at her, although this is just playful teasing within their strong and supportive friendship.Ikuyo KitaKita Ikuyo and Bocchi first met when Bocchi approached her. Despite being strangers, they quickly became close friends when Bocchi recruited Kita again to join the Kessoku Band. They also attended the same school and were in the same class during their second year. Bocchi taught Kita how to play guitar during the early days of their friendship, and she was also the one who helped Kita reconcile with the other band members after her sudden disappearance.Although they have a strong friendship, they both have their weaknesses. Bocchi feels insecure about her ability to make friends compared to Kita's outgoing personality, while Kita is insecure about Bocchi's talent and determination. Despite this, they rarely argue, except for the time when Kita became uncomfortable with Bocchi's obsession with keeping their band photo as tiled walls in her closet, which led her to distance herself from Bocchi for a few days.Kita is known for her politeness and addresses Bocchi by her last name, \"Gotoh-san.\" Later, as they became closer friends, Kita started calling her \"Hitori-chan,\" while another band member called her \"Bocchi.\" Kita is also aware of Bocchi's social anxiety and wants to help her overcome it. However, her attempts sometimes end up making things worse for Bocchi, such as when she gave her a chance to speak during their cultural festival live, which resulted in Bocchi's stage dive incident. Despite this, neither Bocchi nor Kita seem to dwell on these mishaps.Seika IjichiAt first, Bocchi was intimidated by Seika's unfriendly and strict personality when she first joined STARRY. Seika's demeanor often made Bocchi nervous about her job and performance. However, Seika actually considers Bocchi to be a great person with untapped potential as both a guitarist and as an individual. Unfortunately, Seika struggles to effectively communicate these thoughts to Bocchi, which has left Bocchi largely unaware of Seika's true feelings. While their relationship is primarily that of employer and employee, there are moments when they do genuinely care for each other.Kikuri HiroiKikuri is like an older sister to Bocchi and greatly admires Hiroi's skills as a bassist. Their first meeting was during a street live performance in Kanazawa-Hakken, where Hiroi's encouraging words helped Bocchi learn a lot. Hiroi also recognized Bocchi's potential as a guitarist and became a huge supporter of her band, attending all their performances.However, Bocchi is not fond of Hiroi's behavior off-stage, as she sometimes causes trouble for the crowd due to her excessive drinking. Hiroi also has a tendency to borrow money from Bocchi and others, which can be frustrating.Futari GotohBocchi finds it challenging to get along with Futari because of their contrasting personalities. She often feels hurt by Futari's blunt comments and inferior due to being placed at the lowest tier of the \"Futari Family Pyramid.\" Despite this, their sibling relationship remains positive, and Futari occasionally shows support toward Bocchi.Naoki GotohNaoki played a significant role in Bocchi's guitar journey as he allowed her to borrow his guitar and even set up her guitarhero channel. Being a former musician himself, Naoki understands the struggles that come with learning an instrument, and he always provides Bocchi with helpful advice and support whenever she faces difficulties. He is Bocchi's most expressive supporter among all her family members and often records her performances on his camcorder during events or occasions.However, Naoki tends to be brutally honest with his opinions, which sometimes includes not believing in Bocchi's ability to make friends through her music because of his impression of her. Despite this, his intentions are always well-meaning, and he truly wants the best for Bocchi.Michiyo GotohBocchi's mother is known for being both nurturing and strict towards her daughter. She has always been supportive of Bocchi's interests and activities, while also providing constructive criticism when necessary. Despite her understanding of Bocchi's social struggles, she never hesitates to address any problematic behaviors, whether they occur in Bocchi's personal life or band activities. While she tends to be honest about her views of Bocchi with others, she never scolds Bocchi for her introverted tendencies. Instead, she encourages her to step out of her comfort zone while respecting her boundaries.EtymologyThe name Hitori means \"alone, one person\" („Å≤„Å®„Çä).Hitori's surname Gotoh means \"rear, remainder\" (Âæå go) and \"wisteria\" (Ëó§ tou).Her nickname Bocchi comes from hitoribocchi („Å≤„Å®„Çä„Åº„Å£„Å°), meaning \"loneliness.\"Bocchi means \"loner\" in Japanese slang.TriviaHer surname is derived from Masafumi Gotoh.Her birthday, February 21 (2/21) is a reverse reading of his birthday, December 2 (12/2).Some fans had speculated that her nickname \"Bocchi\" was made based on his nickname \"Gotch\" and that the title \"Bocchi the Rock!\" is also named after his book GOTCH GO ROCK! („Ç¥„ÉÉ„ÉÅË™ûÈå≤). However the author Hamazi Aki clearly denied them, so it is a pure coincidence.[31][32]Despite deriving her name to Masafumi Gotoh, Bocchi's role in a band was more related to Kensuke Kita, the lead guitarist of Asian Kungfu GenerationHer first guitar is a Gibson Les Paul Custom 1968 Reissue Ebony, which she borrowed from her father Naoki.The guitar's brand is the same as Yui Hirasawa from K-ON!, but the model is different; the latter owns a Gibson Les Paul Standard '50s Heritage Cherry Sunburst.Along with the guitar she uses a Boss Blues Driver (BD-2) effects pedal, though this wasn't animated correctly in the anime.In episode 12 of the anime, Bocchi is shown to use a Boss BD-2 Blues Driver, a ProCo RAT, a Dunlop GCB-95 CryBaby Wah and a Boss MS-3 Multi-FX Switcher, all of which is powered by a Custom Audio Japan AC/DC Station v2, along with a Marshall JCM900 guitar amplifier.In chapter 42 of the manga, upon finding a pedal some fans believe to be a Klon Centaur, based on its recognizable design, in a second-hand store, she mentions having wanted that pedal for a while, but not buying it previously because it was too expensive.Her second guitar is a custom Yamaha PACIFICA611VFM, part of the PAC600 series. This specific model is exclusive to Bocchi the Rock! series. It appears to be a Yamaha PACIFICA611VFM - Translucent Black with a black pickguard, rather than the stock tortoise shell pickguard.[33]In the magazine release of chapter 21 however, the guitar color was originally Dark Red Burst. This was later changed to the current custom black in the volume 2 tank≈çbon version of the chapter and subsequently the anime.Yamaha actually did a real model of it, which is exclusive to the 2 winners of the lucky draw held in Japan after the last episode of the anime airs.Another Yamaha-related item that Bocchi has is a THR5 amplifier, which she used for her guitar playing at home.Her Steinberger audio interface seen in the anime is also distributed by Yamaha in Japan.It takes her two hours to get to STARRY from her house.[34]Her home is near to Kanazawa-hakkei Station (ÈáëÊ≤¢ÂÖ´ÊôØÈßÖ), Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture.[17] The scenery of the Kanazawa-hakkei area can be seen in episodes 6 and 7 of the anime.[35] The station is located about 37 linear kilometers (23 miles) away from Shimokitazawa Station, the nearby station from STARRY.In the English subtitles on Crunchyroll, Hitori Goto was used in episode 1, but later was fixed.She used to lie on her guitarhero channel, often saying that she usually went to a karaoke bar to sing with her friends, and even had a boyfriend.[27]She was never seen wearing a school uniform blouse and often wears her pink tracksuit alongside with maroon band t-shirt underneath.[36]She is the only member of Kessoku Band that doesn't have a microphone whenever they perform.Originally Hamazi planned for Bocchi to look more cheerful, however, this was rejected by the editor since it does not look serious enough for her work.[37]Hitori's nickname guitarhero is a reference to the rhythm game series published by Activision, Guitar Hero.References‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 1, chapter 1, page 8‚Üë Jump up to:2.0 2.1 Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 1, chapter 2, page 22‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 1, chapter 4, page 35‚Üë Jump up to:4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 \"Bocchi the Rock!\" TV Animation Official Guidebook -COMPLEX-‚Üë Volume 1 purchase bonus 4p from the official setting document collection (booklet).‚Üë Translated from the official website.‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 1‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 1, chapter 1‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 1, chapter 2‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 1, chapter 3‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 1, chapter 4‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 1, chapter 5‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 1, chapter 6‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 1, chapter 7‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 1, chapter 8‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 1, chapter 9‚Üë Jump up to:17.0 17.1 Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 1, chapter 10‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 1, chapter 11‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 1, chapter 12‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 1, chapter 13‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 2, chapter 14‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 2, chapter 15‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 2, chapter 16‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 2, chapter 17‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 2, chapter 18‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 2, chapter 20‚Üë Jump up to:27.0 27.1 Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 2, chapter 21‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 2, chapter 22‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 2, chapter 23‚Üë Bocchi the Rock! manga - Volume 2, chapter 24‚Üë „ÅØ„Åæ„Åò„ÅÇ„Åçüé∏ [@hamazi__] (2023, February 18). \"„Éî„ÇØ„Ç∑„ÉñÁôæÁßë‰∫ãÂÖ∏„ÅÆ„Åº„Åñ„ÇçË™≠„Çì„Åß„Åü„ÇâÁßÅ„ÇÇÁü•„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑ‰∫ãÂÆü„Åå...„Çø„Ç§„Éà„É´„ÅÆÁî±Êù•„Å£„Å¶„Åù„ÅÜ„Å†„Å£„Åü„ÅÆ‚Ä¶ÔºÅÔºüÈÉΩÂ∏Ç‰ºùË™¨„Å£„Å¶„Åì„ÅÜ„ÇÑ„Å£„Å¶Â∫É„Åæ„Å£„Å¶„Åè„Çì„Åß„ÇÑ„Çì„Åô„Å≠\" [Tweet].
