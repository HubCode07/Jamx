**Upgrading Project**
* We have launched the Alpha Version of Active Text-to-Text Conversation in Discord Chats, although experimental, it will allow the bot to imitate a person (with their consent) and/or act as a member in the server, which can read videos, and texts, pictures, and audio and put out text. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d23e962-3c3d-4d51-a833-33b254e2168a)
* We are relaunching the Random Level Box, with a new layout and design system. The modern version of Jamx will be on 24/7 and will be based entirely on commands.
